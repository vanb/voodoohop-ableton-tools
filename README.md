Voodoohop Live Tools
- shows the waveforms of tracks playing in your live in a convenient floating window
- reads the warp markers of the audio files and shows the properly warped waveform
- if you have a software like mixed in key or the free keyfinder it will read the scale tags and color the waveforms accordingly
- transposing the clips in live will change the color of the waveform allowing you to quickly match tracks harmonically
and more which i forgot...

sorry mac only for now

Instructions
-------------------

In the following .zip archive there is one application and a Max for Live device.

The Max for Live device is meant to be put on each track in your Live set you want to monitor. It sends the information about the currently playing clip to the Voodoohop Live Tools application which then analyses the metadata etc.

Sorry about the file size. I will reduce it at some point.

Sometimes you have to restart the Voodoohop Live Tools when it just shows "loading..." for example. Just click on the window and hit Apple-R.

To hide and show the window from anywhere you can press Ctrl-Shift-V.

In order for the program to read the warp markers correctly you need to hit the little "save" button on the clip's detail view. Otherwise it will display 120.00bpm and not show the waveform correctly.

Please give me feedback. Let me know if the transposing changes the color properly for example.

If you are interested in participating in development send me a message. The application is written with node.js and react. A small Max for Live device sends the data from the live set to the application.

> Live editing development on desktop app

[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) application boilerplate based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/), [React Transform HMR](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr) for rapid application development

## Screenshot

## Install

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate.git your-project-name
```

And then install dependencies.

```bash
$ cd your-project-name && npm install
```


## Run

Run this two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs.

```bash
$ npm run hot-server
$ npm run start-hot
```

or run two servers with one command

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

*Note: requires a node version >= 4 and an npm version >= 2.*


## DevTools

#### Toggle Chrome DevTools

- OS X: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>I</kbd> or <kbd>F12</kbd>
- Linux: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>I</kbd> or <kbd>F12</kbd>
- Windows: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>I</kbd> or <kbd>F12</kbd>

*See [electron-debug](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-debug) for more information.*

#### DevTools extension

This boilerplate is included following DevTools extensions:

* [Devtron](https://github.com/electron/devtron) - Install via [electron-debug](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-debug).
* [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) - Install via [electron-devtools-installer](https://github.com/GPMDP/electron-devtools-installer).
* [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) - Install via [electron-devtools-installer](https://github.com/GPMDP/electron-devtools-installer).

You can find the tabs on Chrome DevTools.

If you want to update extensions version, please set `UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS` env, just run:

```bash
$ UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS=1 npm run dev

# For Windows
$ set UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS=1 && npm run dev
```

## Externals

If you use any 3rd party libraries which can't be built with webpack, you must list them in your `webpack.config.base.js`：

```javascript
externals: [
  // put your node 3rd party libraries which can't be built with webpack here (mysql, mongodb, and so on..)
]
```

You can find those lines in the file.


## CSS Modules

This boilerplate out of the box is configured to use [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

All `.css` file extensions will use css-modules unless it has `.global.css`.

If you need global styles, stylesheets with `.global.css` will not go through the
css-modules loader. e.g. `app.global.css`


## Package

```bash
$ npm run package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

```bash
$ npm run package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ npm run package -- --[option]
```

#### Options

- --name, -n: Application name (default: ElectronReact)
- --version, -v: Electron version (default: latest version)
- --asar, -a: [asar](https://github.com/atom/asar) support (default: false)
- --icon, -i: Application icon
- --all: pack for all platforms

Use `electron-packager` to pack your app with `--all` options for darwin (osx), linux and win32 (windows) platform. After build, you will find them in `release` folder. Otherwise, you will only find one for your os.

`test`, `tools`, `release` folder and devDependencies in `package.json` will be ignored by default.

#### Default Ignore modules

We add some module's `peerDependencies` to ignore option as default for application size reduction.

- `babel-core` is required by `babel-loader` and its size is ~19 MB
- `node-libs-browser` is required by `webpack` and its size is ~3MB.

> **Note:** If you want to use any above modules in runtime, for example: `require('babel/register')`, you should move them from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`.

#### Building windows apps from non-windows platforms

Please checkout [Building windows apps from non-windows platforms](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager#building-windows-apps-from-non-windows-platforms).

## Dispatching redux actions from main process

see discusses in [#118](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/118) and [#108](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/108)

## How hot-reloading works on Electron

We use [webpack-target-electron-renderer](https://github.com/chentsulin/webpack-target-electron-renderer) to provide a build target for electron renderer process. Read more information [here](https://github.com/chentsulin/webpack-target-electron-renderer#how-this-module-works).

> Note: webpack >= 1.12.15 has built-in support for `electron-main` and `electron-renderer` targets.

## How to keep the boilerplate updated

If your application is a fork from this repo, you can add this repo to another git remote:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate.git
```

Then, use git to merge some latest commits:

```sh
git pull upstream master
```

## Native-like UI

If you want to have native-like User Interface (OS X El Capitan and Windows 10), [react-desktop](https://github.com/gabrielbull/react-desktop) may perfect suit for you.
